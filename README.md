Just a Minute
Just a Minute is a radio panel game that has been running since 1967. On each show, three (or sometimse more) panellists appear, along with a host. A list of the host and panellists of each show is given in the file jam.txt (the source of the list is here). The format of the file is as follows. First the date of each show is given, then the host and a list of panellists (and guests). Finally the topic of the show is given, if it is known.
Write a function jam that takes a string, containing the contents of jam.txt (or a subset of its contents) and returns a dictionary. The keys of the dictionary are the names of the panellists and hosts of the shows, and the value, for each key, is the number of times that person has appeared on the show.
Note that the test cases will all be from jam.txt. The final test case is the whole file.:
# just-a-minute
No. of times each person has appeared on the radio show Just a minute
